# Thoughts

Insightful thought experiment in contrasting tech org culture trends, eg. Google's bias toward Ruinous Empathy vs. Apple's bias toward Obnoxious Aggression.

# Take-Aways

* Praise is diffcult; it needs to be genuninely felt, contextualized, well informed, and personalized; flimsy or inaccurate praise messes with people's minds, sows doubt; praise can be obnoxiously aggressive when it demonstrates a lack of caring personally; not praising people enough is unacceptable
* Criticism is directed at a person's work (the outcomes) rather than the person themself; must be tempered with justification and a plan to get back on track; strong relationship is needed to point out what is unacceptable about the work, but still be trusting in the person's ability
* Operationalizing good guidance: to keep winning, criticize the win; don't let a positive result stop you from taking corrective action, but acknowledge the positive; don't sandwich bad news between insincere good stuff, be real
* Toxic managmenet is common, eg. motivation by humiliation; but "soft management" where managers want to be liked is worse; tolerating incompetence destroys motivation; people would rather work with a competent asshole than a nice incompetent, but there is a false dichotomy; it is not a trade-off
* When you're obnoxiously aggressive, be mindful to course correct for caring more rather than reversing the honesty axis and sliding into manipulative insincerity
* Common mistake to start with Ruinous Empathy with the intent to move into Radical Candor later; this fails to build trust, people don't know where they stand and are afraid to criticize
* Strong relationships enable being direct, frank, candid; relationships do not scale but culture does; build trust with each person who reports to you
* Push decisions out to the teams where people are closest to the facts
* "boss" evokes injustice, "management" sound bureaucratic (petty executors), "leader" sounds self-aggrandizing (BSers who don't do any real work)
* Boss's job is to make people feel productive and connected to their labour; "keep it professional" denies our humanity; we shouldn't repress ourselves to earn a living
* Toxic feelings of superiority - instead of kicking ass, people want to kick your ass; being a boss is a job, not a value judgement
* Boss absorbs the blows; people may never repay you but they are likely to pay it forward; if nobody on your team is mad, probably you aren't pushing them enough; if we have the data, use the data, but if all we have are opinions, let's use yours
* candor is culturally relative; level of directness in Tokyo is much lower than in Israel, had to substitute "radical candor" for "polite persistence"; British education stresses oral argument, they can be more candid than even New Yorkers

# Concepts

* Apple's Culture -  boss role is listening, seeking, debating, and pushing for decisions, as opposed to directing and deciding; see Terry Gross quote (hire contributors to tell their managers what to do); Apple University mandate: defy the gravitational pull of organizational mediocrity
* Bring Your Whole Self to Work - show vulnerability, create a safe space, get to really know people
* Candor - candor is judged at the listener's ear, not the speaker's mouth; it only works if good faith is understood; challenge, but do not attack or nit-pick; not mean, but clear, direct
* Care Personally - prerequisite of Radical Candor, must be personally invested
* Challenge Directly - prerequisite of Radical Candor, must be direct and unambiguous, even when the news is bad; challenge people, make tough decisions
* Cruel Empathy - understanding how people feel and using it against them
* Cycle of Relationships and Responsibilities - virtuous cycle when trust and success feed on each other, vicious cycle when doubt and failure feed on each other; relationships underlie responsibilities, which underlie culture
* Emotional Babysitter - it's called management and it's your job; being the boss comes with emotional labour
* Front-Stabbing - directly attacking people; a behaviour, not a personality trait; be careful that speaking truth to power doesn't devolve into this
* Google's Culture - over-valued rapid career growth trajectory; happy medium is needed
* Kick-Down, Kiss-Up - there is a special place in hell for people who do this
* Manager Feedback Sessions - reports have a chance to review their managers
* Manipulative Insincerity - failure mode, when you neither Care Personally nor Challenge Directly; pushes emotional buttons for short-term gain, easily seen through; only wants to be liked, not mission-driven
* Obnoxious Aggression - failure mode, when you Challenge Directly but fail to Care Personally; typically most desirable of the failure modes, at least people know where they stand; assholes are tolerated because at least they're honest, but they should take the time to grow their humanity
* Radical Candor - combination of Care Personally and Challenge Directly; "radical" because we are trained to avoid speaking frankly; not a personality type, rather a way to gauge criticism; nobody is always successful at Radical Candor
* Rock Star Developers - exceptional results, slow growth trajectory; like the Rock of Gibraltar
* Rockstar Developers - gunning for promotions comes as the expense of team stability
* Ruinous Empathy - failure mode, when you Care Personally but fail to Challenge Directly; Russian anecdote: guy has to amputate his dog's tail, but feels so bad about it that he amputates an inch each day instead of all at once
* Shashlyk - grilled meat
* Three Responsibilities of a Boss - Guidance (feedback, praise & criticism, for the manager too), Team-Building (team composition, motivation), Results (measure outcomes)
* Toyota's Big Red Square - forcefully soliciting criticism; employees stand in the square at the end of their first week and are not allowed to leave until they've come up with three criticisms of the process

# Names Dropped

# Thoughts

# Take-Aways

* Stop starting and start finishing
* Kanban is a visual system; utilize the brain's capacity to grok visualizations
* The common team challenges: often deliver late, inaccurate estimates, swamped with work, unclear priorities, work requests coming from many sources, unclear task assignments
* Inspect and adapt; don't try to define the ideal process, capture how things currently work and revisit it frequently; a goal of the process is to generate discussions about the process
* KPIs often fail, but Lead Time and Throughput are relatively easy to track and worthwhile; the team should choose their own metrics

# Concepts

* Expedite Lane - for high priority work that overrides other WIP
* Information Fridge - data is available but hard to find; in the fridge you have to rummage around for what you want
* Information Radiator - tool that makes data clear and accessible
* Kanban - visualize, limit work in progress, manage flow; from the Japanese "kan-ban," literally "signal card," Kanban tickets should be stickes on a board; is not prescriptive, adapts the process that your team already has (unlike Scrum, XP, and RUP)
* Kanban System - lower-case-k Kanban, visual process management; each visual aid is "a kanban"
* Ketchup Effect - nothing, nothing, nothing, then blam, everything happens at once
* Lead Time - how long it takes for a ticket to go through the entire process
* Penny Flipping Game - each worker flips pennies in a batch and passes along; smaller batches cause more work per individual worker but faster delivery overall
* Rational Unified Process (RUP) - alternative to Scrum, prescriptive
* Task Flow - task journey from investigation through planning and development to delivery and customer approval; team defines their own stages
* The Kanban Method - capital-K Kanban, defined by David J. Anderson
* The Toyota Way - inspiration of Kanban
* Theory of Constraints (TOC) - process is limited by constraints, effective organizations continually identify constraints and adapt
* Throughput - how many tickets arrive in the finished state over a given timeframe
* Work in Process (WIP) - working in smaller batches decreases lead time and creates more slack time; balance between fast flow and worker idle time

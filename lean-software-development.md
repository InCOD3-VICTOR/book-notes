# Thoughts

# Take-Aways

* Software development is a creation process, not a production process; a common mistake is to apply production principles to it.
* Distributed decision-making and concurrent processes tend to out-perform centralized decision-making and sequential processes.
* Defer decisions until they are needed, avoid making irreversible decisions.
* It should be cheap to test and experiment, but tempered with peer review.
* Only analysis and coding contribute to the final product, but all software development steps cost time and money - Winston Royce
* Inventory is a form of waste; in software, this can be unfinished code, dead code, obsolete documentation, unnecessary features, backlog of tasks, etc.
* The most natural process for software development is short learning cycles comprised of investigation, experimentation, and analysis.

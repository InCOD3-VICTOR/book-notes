# About

[10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10](https://10print.org/)

# Thoughts

Should be a fun read.

# Take-Aways

* Code has a social and historical context. The symbols it contains encode assumptions about the environment in which the code was considered useful. Eg. PRINT command from the original 1964 system ran on a teletype.
* Wendy Chun warns against fetishizing code
* C64 Basic does all math in floating point, only casting to int as a param

# Concepts

* "a fragment of substance" - Barthes
* "cultural analysis" - Manovich
* "culturomics" - Michel
* "distant reading" - Moretti
* ; operator - suppresses newline after print
* CHR$ and ASC - from number to char and back
* Critical Code Studies - critical theory applied to code, Marino
* PRINT has a short-form, the ? operator
* Rita Raley - new media theorist
* typographical * indicates a footnote, / indicates a line break; code langs coopted them as operators

# Techs

* Dartmouth Time-Sharing System - hosted the first version of Basic, 1964
* KERNAL - 8k ROM that acts as the C64 OS
* Microsoft Basic 2 - standard for the C64
* PETSCII character set - used by C64
* RENUM command, normalized line numbers, not provided on C64

# Books

* Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman - Stuart Hall book
* Emerging Language Practices - Marino book
* Signifying Nothing - Brian Rotman book
